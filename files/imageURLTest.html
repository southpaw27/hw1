			My interest in photography started at a young age (yes that's me above with my dad's light meter). My dad had always taken photos and bought me a Polaroid camera when I was around five years old. I love taking photos of sporting events and landscapes. I take photos for my college's newpaper, the <a href="http://www.thesandb.com/">Scarlet and Black</a>, and have been published on Time.com <a href="http://keepingscore.blogs.time.com/2012/11/21/new-scoring-record-college-player-nets-138-points/">here</a>!

				<td class="horiz">
					<a href="../images/kate.JPG"> <img src="../images/kate.JPG"
					alt="kate" /> </a>
					<p>Possibly my favorite picture I have taken. This is Kate, Grinnell baseball's biggest fan at her special olympics bowling event</p>
				</td>
				<td class="horiz">
					<a href="../images/fisher.jpg"> <img src="../images/fisher.jpg" alt="fisher" /> </a>
					<p>Taken while on a trip in northern Wisconsin. A random fisherman was casting a line at sunset on a very peaceful lake surrounded by woods.</p>
				</td>
				<td class="horiz">
					<a href="../images/denali.jpg"> <img src="../images/denali.jpg" alt="Denali" /> </a>
					<p>A picture of Denali (Mt. McKinley) taken from a small bush plane. It is rare to see the mountain this clearly, as there is usually heavy cloud cover.</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="horiz">
					<a href="../images/birdFriend.jpg"> <img src="../images/birdFriend.jpg" alt="Bird Friend"/> </a>
					<p>A funny little bird I met while hiking in Alaska. It was very talkative and brazen, allowing me to get very close without flying away.</p>
				</td>
				<td class="vert">
					<a href="../images/dunk.jpg"> <img src="../images/dunk.jpg" alt="Dunk" /> </a>
					<p>Grinnell's Griffin Lentsch slamming down a dunk during a game.</p>
					<br>
				</td>
				<td class="vert">
					<a href="../images/swissAlps.jpg"> <img src="../images/swissAlps.jpg" alt="Swiss Alps" /> </a>
					<p>A picture of a mountain in the Swiss Alps. The low level clouds in the foreground really add to the mystique of the mountains.</p>
