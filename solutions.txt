Solutions to the simple tasks by Andrew Kelley

1. Given a DOS-formatted text file (lines end with \r\n rather
   than just \n), convert it to a standard text file.

	* Sam demonstrated this code as follows:
	  - "tr -d '\r' < dosfile > newfile "

2. Given a standard text file, convert all uppercase letters to lowercase.

	* The code to do this once again uses 'tr':
	  - " tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' < fileWithUppers > fileWithLowers "

3. Given a standard text file, remove all blank spaces at the end of lines.

	* Using sed:
	  - " sed 's/[ \t]*$//' < input.txt > output.txt "
	  - found this at www.unixguide.net/unix/sedoneliner.shtml
	  - have an idea of how it works but not completely sure, 
	    I understand that 's/' is the delete/replace, [ \t] is
	    choosing spaces and tabs, but don't understand the rest.

4. Make a list of all misspelled words in a text file.

	* This uses a Unix tool known as aspell:
	  - " aspell list < fileName "

5. Given a CSV file in which each line has the form
   LastName,FirstName,Assignment,NumericGrade 
   find the the five highest grades on homework 2.

	* This uses many Unix tools pipelined together:
	  - " grep HW2 csvFile | sort -k4 -t, -n -r | cut -f4 -d, |
	      sed -n 1,5p "

6. Given an HTML file, find the URLs of all images. In case you don't know HTML,   those will typically look like  <img ... src="*URL*" ...>
    - The img can have any capitalization (img, IMG, Img, iMg, etc.)
    - There can be other text between the img and the src. (That text cannot 
      include a greater than sign.)
    - You may find it easier to start this problem by assuming that there's 
      only one image tag on a line.
